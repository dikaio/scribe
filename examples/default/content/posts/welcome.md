# Welcome to My New Site!

This is my first post on my new website built with Scribe. I'm excited to share my thoughts and projects with you here.

## What to Expect

This site will be home to:

- Blog posts about my projects
- Tutorials and how-to guides
- My portfolio of work
- Thoughts on technology and design

## Why I Built This Site

I've been wanting a place to share my work and ideas for a long time. After exploring various options, I chose to build this site with Scribe because of its simplicity and flexibility.

Scribe is a lightweight static site generator that makes it easy to create and maintain a website without the complexity of larger systems.
