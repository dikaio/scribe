# References

This directory contains cloned repositories used for reference and inspiration. These external codebases help with ideation of elegant solutions for features to be implemented in the main project.

The contents of repositories cloned into this directory are intentionally git-ignored to avoid committing external code to this project.

## Usage

Clone reference repositories here:

```bash
cd references
git clone https://github.com/example/repo
```

Then use these codebases as reference when discussing implementations with Claude.
