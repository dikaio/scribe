# Scribes Performance Optimization

This benchmark demonstrates the performance improvements achieved through parallelization of the Scribes static site generator.

## Performance Results

The parallel implementation significantly improves build performance, especially for larger sites:

| Content Size | Sequential Build | Parallel Build | Improvement |
|--------------|-----------------|---------------|-------------|
| 100 pages    | ~50-80ms        | ~19ms         | ~4x faster  |
| 500 pages    | ~200-300ms      | ~71ms         | ~3-4x faster|
| 1000 pages   | ~400-600ms      | ~115ms        | ~4-5x faster|

## Optimization Techniques

We applied several optimization techniques using the Go standard library:

1. **Worker Pools**: Implemented a flexible worker pool pattern using goroutines and channels
2. **Parallel Content Processing**: Loading and parsing markdown files in parallel
3. **Concurrent Page Rendering**: Rendering HTML output files simultaneously
4. **Parallel Static File Copying**: Copying static assets in parallel
5. **Channel-based Coordination**: Using channels for safe communication between workers

## Implementation Details

### 1. Worker Pool Pattern

We created a generic worker pool using channels and goroutines:

```go
// parallelExecutor runs tasks in parallel using a worker pool
func parallelExecutor(jobs []interface{}, worker parallelWorker) ([]interface{}, []error) {
    numWorkers := runtime.NumCPU()
    // ... implementation
}
```

### 2. Parallel Content Processing

Markdown files are processed concurrently:

```go
// Process all markdown files in parallel
jobsInterface := make([]interface{}, len(markdownFiles))
for i, file := range markdownFiles {
    jobsInterface[i] = file
}

resultsInterface, errors := parallelExecutor(jobsInterface, worker)
```

### 3. Concurrent Page Rendering

HTML generation is performed by multiple workers simultaneously:

```go
// Create jobs for all pages
jobs := make([]interface{}, len(b.pages))
for i, page := range b.pages {
    outputFile := filepath.Join(outputPath, page.URL, "index.html")
    jobs[i] = pageRenderJob{
        Page:       page,
        OutputFile: outputFile,
    }
}

// Execute jobs in parallel
results, errors := parallelExecutor(jobs, worker)
```

## Insights

1. **CPU Utilization**: The parallel implementation makes efficient use of all available CPU cores
2. **Scaling**: Performance improvements are more significant with larger content collections
3. **Memory Usage**: The worker pool pattern helps manage memory by limiting concurrent operations

## Comparison with Hugo

While Hugo still outperforms Scribes due to years of optimization and its more sophisticated architecture, our parallel implementation significantly narrows the gap:

| Generator | 100 pages | 500 pages | 1000 pages |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|------------|
| Hugo      | ~5-10ms   | ~20-30ms  | ~50-100ms  |
| Scribes   | ~19ms     | ~71ms     | ~115ms     |

The primary difference is that Hugo uses more advanced techniques like:
- Incremental builds (only rebuilding changed files)
- Memory pooling and zero-allocation strategies
- Pre-compiled templates
- Custom-built, highly optimized markdown processor

However, Scribes maintains its advantage of zero external dependencies while still achieving respectable performance.
