# Scribe Refactoring Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed Routing Issue with Pages Outside Posts Directory**
   - Modified URL path extraction logic in `internal/content/page.go`
   - Improved handling of directory structures to maintain proper paths
   - Better detection of post vs. page content types

2. **Removed Tailwind-Related Code**
   - Removed `internal/templates/tailwind.go`
   - Updated embedded templates to only use default templates
   - Simplified CSS handling to use only the default stylesheet

3. **Simplified Site Generation**
   - Updated template creation to use only the default template
   - Removed options for alternative themes/templates in CLI
   - Streamlined the site creation process

4. **Refactored UI Components**
   - Replaced the `internal/ui` package with simpler alternatives
   - Created a new local UI implementation in `pkg/cli/ui.go`
   - Simplified the CLI UI components

5. **Updated Taskfile**
   - Removed tasks that were no longer relevant
   - Improved task descriptions and error handling
   - Fixed the `new` task to use command line arguments without prompting

6. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated README to reflect the simplified codebase
   - Removed references to Tailwind CSS and other removed features
   - Added improved task commands documentation

## Benefits of the Refactoring

1. **Simplified Codebase**: Removed unnecessary complexity and features that were causing confusion.
2. **Improved Routing**: Fixed issues with pages in subdirectories not maintaining their paths.
3. **Reduced Dependencies**: Eliminated the need for Node.js and npm for Tailwind.
4. **Better Developer Experience**: Simplified commands and workflow.
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, more focused codebase with less moving parts.

## Future Improvements

The following areas could be improved further:

1. **Improved Test Coverage**: Adding more tests, especially for the routing and content handling.
2. **Better Error Handling**: Providing more informative error messages.
3. **Documentation**: Expand documentation of the codebase architecture.
4. **Performance Optimizations**: Further optimizing the content generation process.
